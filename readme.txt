A fast and effective plugin to force webpage and media library URLs from HTTP to HTTPS with a permanent redirect.

== Description ==

**An fast and effective way to make sure that all the HTTP URLs get redirected to HTTPS, including the WordPress upload folder for uploaded images and media.**

**This plugin is significantly different than most other plugins of its type** &mdash; other plugins generally create an output filter using [PHP's output buffering](http://php.net/manual/en/function.ob-start.php) to search / replace URLs within the webpage document. This is much slower (and error prone) than using the WordPress 'upload_dir' filter and permanent (301) redirects ([which is considered best practive when moving from HTTP to HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301)).

The plugin defines the following constants (if not already defined), then makes sure that all front-end HTTP requests are redirected to their HTTPS equivalent:

* FORCE_SSL
* FORCE_SSL_ADMIN
* FORCE_SSL_LOGIN

The plugin also hooks the WordPress 'upload_dir' filter, to make sure that all upload directory URLs match the required protocol.

The plugin checks and honors the following proxy / load-balancing web server variables:

* HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO
* HTTP_X_FORWARDED_SSL

<blockquote>
<p>There are no plugin settings &mdash; simply install and activate the plugin.</p>
</blockquote>

**Requirements**

Your web server must be configured with an SSL certificate and able to handle HTTPS request. ;-)
